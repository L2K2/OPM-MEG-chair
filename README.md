# A non-magnetic flat-pack chair

A simple chair for OPM-MEG research systems. The chair geometry is that of a standard relaxed chair. The backrest is at 27 degrees, and the seat at 15 degrees. This makes the chair comfortable to sit for prolonged times, both without or with extra padding or cushions. 

The chair can be manufactured from a single 18 mm sheet of birch plywood with a nice-to-touch ready-for-use surfaces. The design can be used as such, or with a light coat of (tested to be non-magnetic) wood oil to protect the surface from discolouration. Alternatively, any other hardwood plywood can be used. Use of softwood plywood is not adviced as these are typically construction grade and as such need some surface work before use.

The design is held together by a single hardwood wedge from the same sheet.

Some of the parts have sharp interior corners. These can be realised by a hand file after a rounded CNC operation. Alternatively, the chair parts could be laser cut (but this would result in charred surface finish on the cut edges).

The exterior corners have been rounded to reduce the risk of the participant bumping into a sharp corner. For a nicer looking chair, but with worse functionality, remove this rounding and apply wood edge banding to cover the exposed plywood edges.  

There is a selection of mounting holes in the backrest. Not all are needed, but the spares can be used to extend features. The mounting system assumes M12 nylon bolts and nuts. Thus, ideally, each inset hole in the front surface of the backrest (and in the hidden face of the two braces holding up the adjustable helmet mount) should be at minimum 10.0 mm deep prolonged rectangles with their short edge of at least 19.0 mm but not above 19.5 mm (rounded corners are fine). This makes the chair double as a wrench for M12 nuts, facilitating helmet height adjustments whilst a person is sitting on the chair, or with the chair covered in padding. The shown adjustable helmet design should suit for most adults from 150 cm to 200 cm.

The holes in the top surface of the helmet mount have spacing and size compatible with the early versions of FieldLine smart helmet mounting system. Adapt this part to your own system, or if allowed by your local situation, adapt your own system to this reverse-engineered mounting system.
